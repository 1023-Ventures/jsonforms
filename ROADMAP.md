#Roadmap
This roadmap defines our current view on how we will continue with the development of JSON Forms on a very coarse-grained level and is subject to change at any time:

H2/2017:
 * Support for Templating in Custom renderers
 * Tree Master Detail Renderer Improvements (Performance, Icons, DND, contextual actions)
 * Improved Angular 2 Support
 * Improved React Support

H1/2018:
 * JSON Forms-based editor for JSON Schemata
 * JSON Forms-based reflective editor for JSON data based on a JSON Schema

Future:
 * Renderer for Mobile Phones
